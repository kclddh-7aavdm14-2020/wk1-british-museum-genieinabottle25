        <h1>Genie's view on the British Museum</h1>
        <p>This weekâ€™s expedition to the British Museum has been a really great experience and I have learned a lot through my discussion with our group members. </p>
        <p>I always hold a mix feeling on the British Museum because of its history, and it preserves huge amount of collections that originally from other regions and countries such as Africa and China through undignified actions. On the other hand, I also hold the view that a comprehensive museum should manage to gather remarkable collections from all over the world to show different culture and their inherent meaning. </p>
        <p>From the perspective of a website, I love how it present its collections online with different means to introduce them. My favorite part of this website is its Blog section which portrayed its collection  thoroughly and added different means of presentation like 3D models.</p>
